# üîç Lead Scoring Model for X Education

## üß† Problem Overview
X Education, an ed-tech company, aims to improve its **lead-to-sale conversion rate**, which currently hovers around 30%. They want to identify the most promising leads (called **Hot Leads**) to prioritize sales team efforts and boost conversion rates toward a target of 80%.

This project builds a **logistic regression model** that:
- Assigns a **lead score (0‚Äì100)** to each lead
- Helps sales teams target leads most likely to convert
- Supports business decision-making with clear, interpretable insights

---

## üìä Dataset Summary
- ~9,000 leads
- Binary target variable: `Converted` (1 = converted, 0 = not converted)
- Includes features such as:
  - Lead Source
  - Total Time Spent on Website
  - Last Activity
  - Total Visits
  - Specializations
  - What is your current occupation?
  - Tags and other categorical indicators

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some categorical variables have a "Select" option that behaves like missing values and must be cleaned.
